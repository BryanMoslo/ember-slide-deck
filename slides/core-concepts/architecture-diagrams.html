        <img src="finding-unloaded-record-step2-diagram.png" title="Once the request to the server returns with a JSON payload for the requested record, the adapter resolves the promise it returned to the store with the JSON. The store then takes that JSON, initializes the record with the JSON data, and resolves the promise returned to your application with the newly-loaded record." height="370">
        <img src="finding-loaded-record-diagram.png" title="In this case, because the store already knew about the record, it returns a promise that it resolves with the record immediately. It does not need to ask the adapter (and, therefore, the server) for a copy since it already has it saved locally.">
